Creating a component:
Create a class. Should look like this:

class CLASS_NAME extends React.Component {
  render() {

  }
}

A component can have three different aspects to it:
1. State
2. Lifecycle
3. User Interface (UI)

To describe #3 (UI), a component will ALWAYS have render(){} attached to it. Inside of the render body we will return the UI we want displayed. We write this with JSX and Babel will convert JSX into regular JavaScript.

To get the UI displayed on the DOM, we use ReactDOM. It'll consist of two arguments:
1. A React element - JSX creates an element (or an HTML tag) that you can use in ReactDOM 
2. Where to render the element to - this will usually be 

Import CSS to the index.js so the styles apply to the component 

Since modules are being used (React, ReactDOM, etc.) we need to use Webpack to bundle them together. We also need to bring in Babel to transform JSX into JS.

After installing Webpack, create webpack.config.js file and define three import settings:
1. Entry point
2. Where the bundle that webpack creates is going to go 
3. The module rules

Props are a way to pass data into components, just like parameters pass data into functions
PROPS ARE TO COMPONENTS WHAT ARGUMENTS ARE TO FUNCTIONS
Two aspects to props:
1. How to pass data into components
2. How to access props that have been passed in
----------------------------------------------------
To render lists with React you can use .map() but instead of returning another array, you can use JSX to return a list. So it would look like this:

<ul id="tweets">
  {tweets.map((tweet) => (
    <li>
      {tweet.text}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

One caveat: when you use .map to create a list, you have to add a unique key prop to each list item. This is due to the fact that it's React's to render the list as fast as possible. It helps React to know what items, if any, changed throughout different renders of that particular component. So it would look like this:
<ul id="tweets">
  {tweets.map((tweet) => (
    <li key={tweet.id}>
      {tweet.text}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
----------------------------------------------------
When creating a new component, be sure to export it so that it can be fed into the main index.js file. This of course means you must import that new component into the index.js file.
